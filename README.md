# Hello World!
Hello everyone! I'm Facu, and today i'm starting to use GitHub.

I'm interested in programming since like 3 years, and i'm mainly focused on Java, although i'm still learning about this.

I'm fom Argentina, which means i'm a Spanish speaker (Forgive my grammar btw).

I hope that i can collaborate and contribuite to this community.
